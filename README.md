Riksu's Arma Additions is just that: Bunch of Misc Additions to Arma.

Whenever I encounter a feature that would make sense but is missing from Arma, and no other mod has done it, there is only one thing to do: DIY!

That's what this mod is.

Some links:
Features are documented in [Trello](https://trello.com/b/C58Mb1HV)

Mod is built with [HEMMT](https://hemtt.dev/index.html)
